## IMPORTANT
Please check the `improv` branch for latest changes. Master branch has been left intact until complete testing.

## How to run iFogSim ?

* Create a Java project in Eclipse. 
* Inside the project directory, initialize an empty Git repository with the following command
```
git init
```
* Add the Git repository of iFogSim as the `origin` remote.
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/Cloudslab/iFogSim
```
* Pull the contents of the repository to your machine.
```
git pull origin master
```
* Include the JARs (except the CloudSim ones) to your Eclipse project.  
* Run the example files (e.g. VRGame.java) to get started.

# iFogSim (this fork)
* Better build: `mvn clean install` (no `jars` needed)
* Merged `improv` branch
* New `Simulation` abstraction (simplicity FTW)
* Includes our own simulation
